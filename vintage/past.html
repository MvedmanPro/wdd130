            Vintage is something we can be attached to by memories, by<br>
            stories and excitement of hearing those memories that were<br>
            told as stories to younger people. Sometimes we think of<br>
            moments from the past as legendary in terms of fashion, music<br>
            or even cars and maybe want to touch/hold or simply look at them,<br>
            to try to understand how it's like to live like that.<br>

            what can be more fun than a photo in black & white but with<br>

        <h3 class="ponder1">
            It's not only aesthetically pleasing things it's much<br>
            more. The vintage is not only unique by looks and <br>
            history but by the opportunity to have a place in<br>
            nowadays to protect the Earth.<br>

            Vintage Clothing
        </h2>
        <h3 class="ponder2">
            If all of us would take our grand grand parents clothes and start investing in vintage<br>
            clothing we would be living in a much clearer environment, because recycling and<br> 
            reusing those history pieces would reduce carbon emissions and preserve water,<br>
            energy, and other resources. To put it simply: the clothes is already in existence and<br>
            no current resources would be used. Just think about how it'd be great to wear,<br>
            something that has a purpose, that helps the Earth to be patient with us. Pure bliss!<br>

            What can serve for decades?<br>
        </h2>
        <h3 class="ponder3">
            Only higher-quality materials and craftsmanship.<br>
            Before the fast mass-produce of EVERYTHING that we have now, previously it was crafted by hand to last<br> 
            for decades, the reason for that is the speed of life and the thought for the future from the craftsmen, they<br> 
            were putting their work for people to spend money only one time instead of multiple times for the same<br> 
            item. But right now the resources of the Earth are not valued and for huge manufacturing companies it's not<br> 
            a problem to make 1 million items, 500,000 of which will be defective, so the people would need to buy<br> 
            more and more. And for the surprise the rest 500,000 will appear defective a little later, it won't serve even<br> 
            10 years, unfortunately, if not less.<br>
            We can enjoy the precious and high-quality vintage things and help The Earth breathe.<br>
            Fun Fact: classic cars are proven to pollute less than new cars and even electric cars.<br>
            Sounds weird, right? Click [here] to read more about it.<br>
            If talking seriously, there is different ways of development globally and personally and if each one would<br> 
            personally pick the less egoistic way of development, then we have the brilliant past, present and future.<br>
