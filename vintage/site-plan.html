      <h3>Home page 'Present Home'</h3>
      <p>
        retro, vintage, 90's styles.<br>

        those who don't wish to go back in time want to appear in a far future.<br>
        Maybe you're here not for one of these, but for a much bigger perspective.<br>
        If you're here for NOW, stay on this page.<br>
        Or just click whatever you're ready for!<br>
        -------------------------------------------------<br>
        What is the most important to you?<br>
        What is the best?<br>
        The best is now, the best is yet to come.<br>
        ---------------------------------------------<br>
        When you build your "tomorrow", don't forget about your "now".<br>
        ---------------------------------------------------------------<br>


        To see and to observe is different.<br>
        As to live and to exist is different.<br>
        ---------------------------------------<br>
        If you here, i know you have a little free time, so i would like to ask you to stop and think in peace of what is actually important to you.<br>
        The life can be very fast at the time when you're at work, when you're in school and just busy with your daily routine.<br>
        But do you tend to think you're in the present during this? Try to be in the present when there is no work, not a thing for your mind to be<br>
        busy about, what will you think about? Will it be the now: the wind that you feel if you stepped outside; the soft couch you're laying at;<br>
        the smile that's forming on your face? And even now, are you present? Just focus on what you feel right now physically, maybe you are tired<br> 
        of sitting in this pose, change your position to be comfortable in every way possible, cause there is some time to not do anything but to<br>
        be lazy: to focus on the 'NOW'. This page reminds you how important it is to be grateful for the moment you are currently in, of the wind<br>
        on your cheeks, the sun on your skin and the shining stars in the skies. Just feel this peace, and you'll be sure: the best is now.<br>

      <p>
        The small page is here for you<br>
        ----------------------------------------------------<br>
        ...The feelings...<br>
       
        Vintage is something we can be attached to by memories, by<br>
        stories and excitement of hearing those memories that were<br>
        told as stories to younger people. Sometimes we think of<br>
        moments from the past as legendary in terms of fashion, music<br>
        or even cars and maybe want to touch/hold or simply look at them,<br>
        to try to understand how it's like to live like that.<br>
        -------------------------------------------------<br> 
        We all just seek fun and smiles, so here you go!<br>
        what can be more fun than a photo in black & white but with<br>
        the people's smiles so bright?<br>
        -------------------------------------------------------<br>
        What is the benefit of vintage today?<br>
       
        It's not only aesthetically pleasing things it's much<br>
        more. The vintage is not only unique by looks and <br>
        history but by the opportunity to have a place in<br>
        nowadays to protect the Earth.<br>
        -------------------------------------------------------<br>
        Vintage Clothing<br>
        
        If all of us would take our grand grand parents clothes and start investing in vintage<br>
        clothing we would be living in a much clearer environment, because recycling and<br> 
        reusing those history pieces would reduce carbon emissions and preserve water,<br>
        energy, and other resources. To put it simply: the clothes is already in existence and<br>
        no current resources would be used. Just think about how it'd be great to wear,<br>
        something that has a purpose, that helps the Earth to be patient with us. Pure bliss!<br>
        --------------------------------------<br>
        What can serve for decades?<br>
        Only higher-quality materials and craftsmanship.<br>
        Before the fast mass-produce of EVERYTHING that we have now, previously it was crafted by hand to last<br> 
        for decades, the reason for that is the speed of life and the thought for the future from the craftsmen, they<br> 
        were putting their work for people to spend money only one time instead of multiple times for the same<br> 
        item. But right now the resources of the Earth are not valued and for huge manufacturing companies it's not<br> 
        a problem to make 1 million items, 500,000 of which will be defective, so the people would need to buy<br> 
        more and more. And for the surprise the rest 500,000 will appear defective a little later, it won't serve even<br> 
        10 years, unfortunately, if not less.<br>
        We can enjoy the precious and high-quality vintage things and help The Earth breathe.<br>
        Fun Fact: classic cars are proven to pollute less than new cars and even electric cars.<br>
        Sounds weird, right? Click [here] to read more about it.<br>
        If talking seriously, there is different ways of development globally and personally and if each one would<br> 
        personally pick the less egoistic way of development, then we have the brilliant past, present and future.<br>
