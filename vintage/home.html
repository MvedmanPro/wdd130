            If you here, i know you have a little free time, so i would like to ask you to stop and think in peace of what is actually important to you.<br>
            The life can be very fast at the time when you're at work, when you're in school and just busy with your daily routine.<br>
            But do you tend to think you're in the present during this? Try to be in the present when there is no work, not a thing for your mind to be<br>
            busy about, what will you think about? Will it be the now: the wind that you feel if you stepped outside; the soft couch you're laying at;<br>
            the smile that's forming on your face? And even now, are you present? Just focus on what you feel right now physically, maybe you are tired<br> 
            of sitting in this pose, change your position to be comfortable in every way possible, cause there is some time to not do anything but to<br>
            be lazy: to focus on the 'NOW'. This page reminds you how important it is to be grateful for the moment you are currently in, of the wind<br>
            on your cheeks, the sun on your skin and the shining stars in the skies. Just feel this peace, and you'll be sure: the best is now.<br>
