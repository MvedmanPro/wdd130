    <h2>How are you doing everybody?</h2>

    <h3>I'm Kateryna and I'm very happy to start the path to my future degree with all of you!</h3>

    <p> I've got seriously interested in Web Design and Computer Science
      <br>after completing few of Harvard online courses.
      <br>Just gave it a try and discovered coding to be very fun because
      <br>of the things that can be created, which is so inspiring and keeps 
      <br>you motivated to continue the process, 
      <br>even though it can be really hard, the result is truly worth it.
    </p>

    <p>The other thing that i want to share is that even though we all might have
      <br>difficult times in studying i hope we will strengthen our faith
      <br>with each difficulty that we overcome this semester with the help of 
      <br>Heavenly Father through scriptures and prayers.
